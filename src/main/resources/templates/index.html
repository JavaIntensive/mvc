<h1>M-Model</h1>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
Model: A container, created from a blueprint, for zero or more objects that are created, read, updated, and deleted.
        It is accessible by the controller and view; the controller can access and manipulate state, while
        the view displays it.
    </li>

       For example: Imagine Thanksgiving. There is a tradition/blueprint for what is expected, but the actual meal
    can be anything you want. You can update the menu last minute if you lack something, or would like to add a few
    extra appetizers. This meal will be displayed on the dining room table for all of your guests -- the "view."
</ul>


</p>
<h1>V-View</h1>
<p>

View: a visual display of the model in which the user can interact. For example, reading a form, the user can type
    in data that the controller uses to update the model. This in turn updates the view.


</p>
<h1>Controller</h1>

The controller is an intermediary between the view and model. You don't actually see it, but it 'controls' how the object will be
handled.

For example, you go to a restaurant and see the menu, the view. You ask the waiter for a glass of water, and he
updates the model of your meal by coming back with a glass which was determined by the controls in place.

Controller: the user interface for interacting with the model. Handles user's requests and renders appropriate View with Model data.
